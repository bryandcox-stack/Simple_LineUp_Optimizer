# Baseball Lineup Optimizer - Python Dependencies
# 
# This project uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required for core functionality.
#
# The following modules are used (all part of Python standard library):
# - csv: CSV file reading and writing
# - random: Random number generation and sampling  
# - statistics: Statistical calculations (mean, stdev)
# - argparse: Command line argument parsing
# - time: Timing and performance measurement
# - typing: Type hints and annotations
#
# Minimum Python version: 3.6+
# Recommended Python version: 3.8+
#
# To install (if needed):
# pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# No additional packages required - this file exists for compatibility
# and potential future enhancements that may require external dependencies.

# Future optional enhancements could include:
# numpy>=1.19.0          # For advanced statistical operations
# pandas>=1.3.0          # For enhanced data manipulation  
# matplotlib>=3.3.0      # For visualization and plotting
# scipy>=1.7.0           # For advanced optimization algorithms
